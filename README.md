# Streaming service
Streaming process from client side app to server and into the file system.

client side ( enabled video and audio from browser) ---> server ---> file system

Includes client and service. The idea is to record video content from camera and as recording goes on, 
send it to the server for it to store it on the file system. Later file system can be changed to S3 bucket.
